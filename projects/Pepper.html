                    <h4 id="authorName">Sofía González-Villalobos, Yanwei Miao, Julia Renardias</h4>
                    <p id="abstract">Providing care for older adults in Germany is becoming increasingly challenging due to current demographic and social trends. To address this issue, technologies, such as robot-based, are being used to develop and test new ideas on how to provide nursing care. Moreover, many older adults can be affected by memory loss problems. Memory training can play a crucial role in helping ameliorate these issues, improve memory performance, and connect with others. This project aims to offer a memory game that provides residents with a meaningful activity, such as memory training, that they can enjoy and in parallel it may support nursing staff and caregivers in a retirement home through robot-based assistance.</p>

                    <h2 id="chapterTitle">Introduction</h2>
                    <p id="mainText">Germany's current demographic and social trends pose increasing challenges to providing care for older adults (Statisches Bundesamt, 2022). In response to this, digital technologies are being harnessed to explore innovative approaches in nursing care provision. The objective is not to replace face-to-face care work but rather to enhance and supplement it (Abdi, 2018). Given the complex nature of this situation, the role of academia has become indispensable in analyzing potential strategies to support the health of older adults, including the utilization of robot-based assistance (Carros, 2020). This technology aims to provide social companionship to the elderly, in addition to the physical aid typically provided by caregivers (Broekens, 2009). Furthermore, it holds the potential to improve the well-being of older adults and alleviate the workload of caregiving staff (Kachouie, 2014). Moreover, memory training has been recognized as a crucial element in assisting older adults in mitigating memory loss problems (APA, 2022), enhancing their memory performance (Blue, 2020), and fostering social connections (Broekens, 2009). The primary aim of this project is twofold. Firstly, it aims to offer support to nursing staff and caregivers in a retirement home through the implementation of robot-based assistance. Secondly, it seeks to provide residents with meaningful activities, such as memory training, that they can enjoy, find motivation in, and potentially collaborate with other residents to solve challenges. </p>
                    
                    <h2 id="chapterTitle">Literature review</h2>
                    <p id="mainText">The study explored key aspects related to older adults' memories, medical causes, professional practices, and the potential of technology for memory training, including robot-based technology for support. Aging can lead to changes in specific brain areas, affecting personal reflections on the past and future during conversations (Wank, 2020). Memory difficulties in seniors may stem from the accumulation of a vast volume of memories rather than an inability to remember (Thompson, 2022). Recall and sharing of memories are important for older adults, promoting brain training, social connection, and meaning in life. Reminiscing is considered beneficial in psychological practice with older adults, as highlighted in the American Psychological Association's guidelines (APA, 2022). Reminiscence therapy, utilizing life histories, has shown positive effects. The development of technology, such as smartphone-based cognitive assessment, offers precise estimation and tracking of cognitive abilities, potentially aiding in early detection of conditions like Alzheimer's disease (Grilli, University of Arizona, 2020).</p>
                    <p id="mainText">Robot-based assistance is another strategy to support older adults' health, providing social companionship and reducing caregivers' workload (Carros, 2020; Broekens, 2009; Kachouie, 2014). These insights and the potential of technology have influenced our design concept. </p>
                    
                    <h2 id="chapterTitle">Methodology</h2>
                    <p id="mainText">To enhance our understanding of older adults' daily routines, their memory processes, and their initial impressions of robot-based technology, specifically the Pepper robot, qualitative research was conducted. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with residents and a caretaker in a nursing home in Germany. The interviews aimed to elicit insights into physical activities, socializing, reminiscing, and perceptions of the Pepper robot. Participant demographics were recorded to provide a better understanding of the population under study.</p>
                    <p id="mainText">The findings regarding daily routines revealed that despite residing in a care home and following a similar schedule, many older adults displayed a keen interest in physical activities, irrespective of their disabilities. Additionally, a significant number of participants enjoyed socializing over afternoon coffee with a small group of friends, providing an opportunity for engaging in discussions. When it came to memories, it was evident that older adults frequently engaged in reminiscing and showed a strong inclination to share their cherished moments with others. Among the various topics discussed, beautiful travel memories emerged as the most popular. Notably, photographs served as the primary method for archiving and preserving these treasured memories. Regarding technology, an intriguing finding emerged from the interviews. While some elderly individuals viewed robots as mere machines, associating their purpose with manual labor, many others found Pepper's humanoid appearance appealing and expressed a genuine fondness for it.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="chapterTitle">Concept</h2>
                    <p id="mainText">Building upon the team's findings and recognizing the value of reminiscing for older adults and the role of technology in supporting caregiving, several requirements were identified for the program. Firstly, it should be designed for group settings, as peer interactions can motivate active engagement among older adults. Secondly, it should encourage the recall of specific memories, thereby enhancing cognitive functions. Thirdly, the program should consider the individual interests and preferences of older adults to create a personalized memory training experience. Lastly, it should prioritize building a trusting and reliable relationship between participants and the Pepper robot.</p>
                    <p id="mainText">Based on these requirements, a game concept was developed to train the memory of older adults in nursing homes, utilizing the interactive capabilities of the Pepper robot. The game involves Pepper narrating shared experiences and prompting participants with specific questions to recall details from their memories. Designed for small groups of two to four participants, the game creates a comfortable and intimate setting that fosters interactions and conversations. The humanoid appearance of Pepper, coupled with carefully crafted dialogues, aims to establish a sense of friendship and familiarity, encouraging older adults to perceive Pepper as a companion.</p>
                    <p id="mainText">While caretakers may not always be available to provide one-on-one attention, Pepper serves as an emotional companion, helping to alleviate the limited caregiver availability in nursing homes. It's important to note that Pepper's role is not intended to replace human interaction or substitute the vital role of caretakers but rather to support the care provided by them. The prototype of the concept featured two distinct storylines based on past experiences, such as a trip to a zoo and a Carnival celebration. The game utilized images from these activities, and the Choreograph software was programmed to incorporate voice recognition features, identifying correct and incorrect answers. Additionally, an interface for the tablet was designed using HTML and CSS to showcase the event pictures and support storytelling.</p>
                    <p id="mainText">To refine the concept, two testing sessions were conducted in the lab to address initial issues, including adjusting voice recognition sensitivity and iterating on the design. Subsequently, the prototype was taken to a nursing home, where two additional testing sessions were conducted during leisure hours, gathering further feedback and insights.</p>

                    <h2 id="chapterTitle">Discussion</h2>
                    <p id="mainText">The interviews with residents provided valuable insights for program implementation. Sports activities tailored to residents' physical abilities were included in the weekly routine, along with memory training group sessions led by caregivers. Positive memories were important, with residents frequently sharing experiences and displaying photographs. Technological support was limited due to issues like poor eyesight or difficulty in using technology effectively.</p>
                    <p id="mainText">Familiarity was crucial in developing a program for seniors, ensuring even cognitively impaired residents could participate. Personalized storytelling using pictures and brief notes received a positive response. However, there were limitations in direct interaction with the robot, requiring assistance for understanding and maintaining fluid conversations. An "Help" option was programmed to assist residents without giving up on finding solutions, but managing group interactions proved challenging.</p>
                    <p id="mainText">Ethical considerations are vital in implementing digital technologies for older adults, prioritizing their needs, autonomy, and right to refuse technology use. Decision-making processes should be based on scientific knowledge. Interacting with the robot generated curiosity and interest, fostering engagement and problem-solving. Technical issues were calmly handled, and the program brought joy and active thinking. Tracking cognitive states through the game could aid in preventing future deficits.</p>

                    <h2 id="chapterTitle">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p id="mainText">The storytelling memory game utilizing the Pepper robot has shown promising results in training older adults' memory and enhancing their cognitive functioning through reminiscing with pictures. Participants expressed curiosity and interest in interacting with Pepper, finding it enjoyable and motivating to receive positive reinforcement for answering quiz questions correctly. The humanoid appearance of Pepper was well-received, fostering an open attitude and friendly expressions among the participants. Incorporating personal pictures in the game evoked joy and prompted lively discussions about past experiences. However, adjustments to the voice recognition system are necessary to accommodate older adults' voice capabilities, and the role of caregivers should be considered to provide adequate support. It is crucial for digital tools to prioritize the needs of older people, ensuring a sense of control and autonomy to avoid demotivation. Long-term observation is needed to determine the game's actual impact on participants' brain performance, particularly for those with dementia or other brain diseases. </p>
                    <p id="mainText">For newcomers to the retirement home or individuals without past group activities, engaging them in the game might be more challenging due to their lack of familiarity and absence of personal pictures. Additionally, displaying pictures of recently deceased individuals may cause confusion or unwanted emotions, requiring further research on how participants perceive such concepts, especially those with dementia or mental instability. Memory games and socialization activities are vital for seniors in retirement homes, but the shortage of staff often leads to cancellations or unavailability. Incorporating robotics and regular cognitive training can partially address this gap, allowing residents to actively participate in life despite not replacing staff. As a future improvement, transitioning from a voice-recognition program to a multi-modality approach could better accommodate the capabilities of older adults and enhance the overall effectiveness of the concept.</p>
