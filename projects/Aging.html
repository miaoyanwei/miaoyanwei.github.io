                    <h4 id="authorName">Maryam Akbarinigjeh, Yanwei Miao</h4>
                    <p id="abstract">Many countries have entered an ageing society. With the rapid development of science and technology, there has been a great deal of research on the social digital technologies, yet the relationship between older adults and these technologies is always neglected. The incapacity of older individuals to effectively use technological products leads them to be more socially isolated. Nowadays, the corona has made this phenomenon even more severe. Our review aimed to summarise the current literature on the social digital interventions for alleviating loneliness and social isolation among older people. This paper is organised as follow: First, we briefly discuss the fact that the world is currently ageing and how organisations around the world are taking this seriously. Next, we describe the methods we employed for conducting our literature review and data analysis. Some important terms are then summarised from the literature. After that, the current strategies and challenges that are introduced from the literature are therefore addressed. We also take note of the findings and opportunities from the literature. Finally, we draw a conclusion and acknowledge our limitations.</p>

                    <h2 id="chapterTitle">Introduction</h2>
                    <p id="mainText">In recent years, scholars from several academic disciplines have focused their attention on the importance of older people's roles and well-being in social structure. This is mostly caused by the steadily rising population of elderly individuals. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2030, there will be 1.4 billion people in the world who are 60 or older, and this number is predicted to double by 2050. The key fact is that if the elderly are not provided with the appropriate care today, they will have a variety of problems in the future, and these issues will continue in the wave of global aging. Due to physical and financial problems, the elderly establish less communication with friends and people around them, which leads to a number of issues, including depression, loneliness, and social isolation [4, 5]. Every person's mental health is greatly influenced by their social relationships, and societies with more interpersonal communication will have greater psychological health. Telecommunications and Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) have a role to play in achieving healthier ageing and helping improve socioemotional outcomes. To focus on the critical role of ICT, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) announced "Digital Technologies for Older People and Healthy Aging" as the theme of World Telecommunication and Information Society Day (WTISD) in the year 2022 [11].</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="chapterTitle">Methodology</h2>
                    <p id="mainText">Using the keywords "older adults," "loneliness," and "technology," for instance, we searched the literature on Google Scholar and discovered the 8 publications listed in TABLE 1, which are all significant and positively related based on the abstract. After deciding on the literature, we each read 2 to 3 papers and then took notes on Miroboard of all the findings. Thereafter, in order to compare and synchronise the data, we set up meetings and held discussions regarding our findings. A summary of all the literature we reviewed is provided in the tables below.</p>

                    <p id="mainText">Particular problems associated with aging which is thought to be critical determinants of well-being for older people are loneliness and social isolation [6]. Although loneliness and social isolation are closely related, they are studied as separate entities. A deeper comprehension of these concepts is needed to facilitate the development of ways to deal with them [5,6].

                            <td>Loneliness is the distressing feeling experienced during perceived social isolation, akin to thirst or hunger pangs (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010). Loneliness varies in intensity, duration, and frequency (Barreto et al., 2021) and is usually distinguished between either a perceived lack in close relationships and feelings of emptiness (emotional loneliness), or a perceived lack of belonging to larger networks/- groups/communities (social loneliness) (Russell, Cutrona, Rose, & Yurko, 1984; Weiss, 1973, pp. xxii–236).</td>
                            <td>Social isolation is by itself associated with poorer health outcomes; the psychological experience of loneliness makes an additional, unique contribution to illness and mortality. Loneliness predicts specific declines in physical, cognitive, and emotion regulation capabilities (Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2009). Loneliness in older people is a risk factor for cognitive decline, cardiovascular disease, reduced immunity, and other physical health problems (Cacioppo et al., 2015).</td>

                    <p id="mainText">Therefore, researching both factual facts and subjective feelings together may provide a more comprehensive knowledge of mental health, particularly in the context of the findings of intervention studies [5]. As Stuart et al. [1] believe that interventions hold great potential to reduce loneliness by targeting this complex set of cognitive, emotional, and social factors.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="chapterTitle">Current Strategies</h2>
                    <p id="mainText">Current strategies to overcome loneliness and social isolation among older adults were demonstrated in the literature.</p>
                    <p id="mainText">The strategies used by older people to manage loneliness are a combination of engaging with the social and physical world, cognitive coping strategies, and private strategies that they do not disclose to anyone [1].</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="chapterTitle">Challenges</h2>
                    <p id="mainText">The adoption of technology for social connections among older adults demonstrates certain challenges, according to the literature.</p>
                    <p id="mainText">Research on the association between older individuals' mental health and social technology use may be inconsistent due to a lack of clarity on how to define social communication outcomes and a lack of research on the types of technologies used for communication. This means that while some research indicates that older adults benefit from online social networking, other research findings are conflicting, particularly given the relative lack of studies focused on this subject. For instance, connecting with online communities may reduce time spent with family, or some older adults may be reluctant to use online platforms due to privacy concerns, lack of understanding of how to use them, and lack of user-friendly options for them [5].</p>
                    <p id="mainText">Digital technology is reportedly less often used by older people to make new connections (Liddle et al., 2021), they primarily use technology to maintain in-person relationships. Furthermore, digital interventions are frequently considered to be ill-suited for older adults due to decreased internet access and lack of digital communication skills (Coelho & Duarte, 2016; Office for National Statistics, 2020). Moreover, while there is some evidence that older adults may have increased their usage of communicative technology, this may be linked to increased rather than decreased loneliness (Choi, Hammaker, DiNitto, & Marti, 2022; Holaday et al., 2021) [1].</p>

                    <h2 id="chapterTitle">Findings</h2>
                    <p id="mainText">After performing a comprehensive analyses of the retrieved reviews, we summed up the collected evidence in order to highlight the most important findings.</p>
                    <p id="mainText">Quantitative and qualitative evidence is provided to support the function of ICT in alleviating social isolation among seniors, but a small number of participants included in these studies impedes the generalizability of findings, claim Stojanovic et al. [2]. They believe the success of technology in combating social isolation and loneliness is related to improvement of older people's communication with family and friends, as well as the possibility to easily access the news and other useful information.</p>
                    <p id="mainText">Stuart et al. [1] believe that according to the Social Identity Approach to Health (SIAH), the key to reducing/mitigating loneliness is to help people find and sustain the group memberships that provide these psychological resources of meaning, connection, support, and agency. However, the challenge of technology adoption and continued use is one of the key challenges since attrition from digital technologies, including apps is often very high (Lazar et al., 2015).</p>
                    <p id="mainText">Latikka et al. [3] reviewed 23 studies conducted from 2006 to the end of May 2021, and discovered the focus was on detection and prediction in less than half of the studies, whereas the alleviation of loneliness or social isolation was the focus in most of the considered studies. They also found that studies focusing on loneliness and social isolation alleviation, older adults have been introduced most often to social robots. However, none of the studies report the complete elimination of older adults’ loneliness experiences with the help of physical ICT, but they report success in alleviating them.</p>

                    <p id="mainText">Overall, many methods show a promising research path for overcoming loneliness and social isolation. Some forms of physical ICT hold promising value in alleviating older adults’ loneliness; significant positive results were obtained in interventions using social robots, an ambient activity system that includes an activity sensor, and a smart home solution [3].</p>
                    <p id="mainText">However, there is still a long way to go in order to address issues like the distrust that older adults have for technology, the frustrating ways of interaction that older people engage with it, and the fact that advanced technology is actually leaving them feeling even more lonely and isolated. The good news is that numerous scholars who are working to find solutions have also contributed a variety of suggestions.</p>
                    <p id="mainText">In additon, to ensure that older people and their support networks are properly engaged in the design process, many papers raised that user-centred design (UCD) methodologies are vital for understanding and accommodating older adults' needs and the needs of their social groups/networks [1], therefore, interventions should engage older people as active participants and should involve older people in the process of planning, implementation and evaluation stages [2], and ICT accessibility requirements and standards must be considered from the design stage to ensure that products and services are accessible to all [4,8].</p>

                    <p id="mainText">This review mainly refers to 8 papers due to time restrictions. Additionally, because we do not live in the same area, it was difficult for us to meet frequently throughout the semester break to discuss our findings. However, we appreciated the work and think the topic of an ageing society to be very meaningful, which we would like to explore further in the future.</p>
