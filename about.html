                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>My design journey kicked off when I was a kid, but my real adventure began when I decided to pursue a bachelor's in Industrial Design.
                        After that, I wanted to dive deeper into the digital world, so I went for a master's in Interaction Design. 
                        That's where I really got into the nitty-gritty of digital design.<br><br>
                        With a solid foundation in design, I've fully embraced design thinking and cultivated a user-centred mindset, it's been helpful during my 4-year gig as an Interaction Designer. 
                        Working closely with awesome teams from different departments also broadened my perspective, pushing me to design with more structure and adaptability.<br><br>
                        My curiosity about development led me back to university for another master's, this time in HCI. 
                        Here, I got hands-on with frontend development in some cool projects.
                        I'm constantly learning and working towards being a "full-stacker".
                        I genuinely enjoy working and researching in this field, and strive to make my designs meaningful to make the world a little better!
